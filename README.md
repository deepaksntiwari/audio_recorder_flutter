# audio_recorder

This audio recorder is a privacy-focused audio recorder that encrypts the data as soon as you record your audio, then decrypts the audio when you are playing, and it will delete the decoded file as soon as you close the window.

When you first open the app, you have to set a passcode. 
After setting up the passcode, you have to enter the passcode to enter the application. 
When you enter the right passcode, you will be greeted with a pop-up that will have the encryption keys, which will be used to encrypt the audio which you are going to record in  application.

You do not have to enter the encryption keys by yourself. You just need to store the encryption keys in a secure place for future use. Our application by default saves those keys in secure storage for its usage. But when you reinstall our application, that keys will be gone. Then you need to enter the encryption keys so that you can encrypt or decrypt the existing audio files.
